# GreetingsðŸ‘‹ I'm Niqi Liu.

I am a third-year Master's student in Media Technology at [Tsinghua University](https://www.tsinghua.edu.cn/), advised by Professor [Yong-Jin Liu](https://cg.cs.tsinghua.edu.cn/people/~Yongjin/Yongjin.htm). Previously, I earned my Bachelor's degree at the Department of Computer Science and Technology, Tsinghua University.

My research interest lies in integrating **data mining** with **cognition science** to facilitate human well-being, with an emphasis on **affective computing**. In this domain, I have delved into <u>time-series analysis, contrastive learning, learning with noise, and generative models</u>.
